## Summary

Although the majority of reviews were 5-star, a very small percentage of those were paid Vine reviews. Based on these results, there is no evidence of positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. To reinforce these findings, additional analysis could be performed of only paid Vine reviews to determine the percentage of overall paid reviews that are 5-star. Additionally, the analysis could be performed on other review categories to compare the results and determine if there is any evidence of bias in the Vine program reviews.
